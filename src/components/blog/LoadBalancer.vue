      <p id="15ee5cfc-8a12-4fd8-a1d0-5e6ce8fe79d2" class="">
        The current flowing through a wire dissipates heat according to the
        Joule equation. If the heat dissipated by electrons flowing inside the
        wire is too high, the wire can be damaged. Circuit breakers limit the
        amount of current that can flow through the wire, thus limiting the
        amount of heat generated by the flow and preventing damage to the wire.
        If a circuit breaker detects a current above the allowed limit, it will
        open its contacts and stop the flow of current.

        limiting the current?

        The reason behind under-sizing the installation
      </h3>
      <p id="be1ce964-7af3-40e4-a5d6-267ff04bc1d9" class="">
        The easiest way to dimension an electric installation is to simply add
        up the current demanded by all the appliances under a certain node and
        choose a circuit breaker and wire that can handle that current. However,
        the cost of installation materials, such as wires and circuit breakers,
        increases significantly with the current handled by the elements. To
        reduce costs, we need to consider the simultaneity factor of the system,
        which indicates how many electrical loads will be consuming electricity
        at the same time. By taking this factor into account, we can get a more
        realistic estimate of the system&#x27;s power consumption and reduce the
        size and cost of the installation materials.
      </p>
      <p id="1a560a65-181d-465e-b5cb-618648279aa7" class="">
        But how can we determine the system simultaneity factor? Let&#x27;s
        leave that question for another dayâ€¦

      <h2>The problem in its (almost) simplest version</h2>
      <p id="a45ef1f4-8ed0-4482-b186-6df877792cf3" class="">
        We have seen that real-world installations may be undersized due to cost
        constraints, and circuit breakers are installed to protect against
        high-simultaneity situations where the current may damage the wires. The
        problem statement is as follows:
        <strong
          >Develop a system that manages electrical loads to prevent circuit
          breakers from opening their contacts. </strong
        >This type of problem is called load balancing and it's typically found
        in server-client infrastructures.

      <p id="54d14ef6-991c-4a29-a4d2-7284cc1e4484" class="">
        Actually, the problem could be simplified even further by considering a
        single circuit breaker, that is a tree with a only a root node and leaf
        nodes, but for the sake of brevity we're allowing intermediate nodes
        from the beginning.

          equal to the current demand of that load, so the demand has been fully
          satisfied. The filling of the orange buckets represent the sum of all
          the current setpoints below a certain circuit breaker. A completely

        One of the inputs of the system is the current demand of the electrical

        The most accepted workaround is to do a ramp up until the car doesn't
        demand more current. That is, start by demanding the lowest amount of
        current, seeing if the car takes that current, then increasing the
        current demand by a small amount, seeing if the car takes that current,
        â€¦ and so on until either the car doesn't take the new current or the EV
        charger reaches its maximum current.

      <h2>An initial solution</h2>
      <p id="6f585889-d4d1-42ff-9479-54858e3fc201" class="">
        To optimize the distribution of current among loads, we introduce the
        concept of tasks. A task contains the current demand of a certain load.
        The tasks are prioritized with a certain criteria and then iterated,
        reserving the demanded current amount of each task on the tree nodes.
        This is done by starting at the leaf node that represents the load and
        walk up the tree reserving current on the intermediate nodes above it
        until the root node is reached. The reserved current for each node must
        be counted and limited to the circuit breaker limit. If a load demands
        current in a node that is already saturated, it will have to wait until
        the limiting node has available current.

        One of the keys factors of the method explained above is the
        prioritization of tasks. In a saturated scenario, where the load demand
        current over the circuit breakers limits, changing the priority of the
        tasks will allow to rotate the loads that take current. Some of the
        possible and most interesting prioritization criteria are the following:

        Instead of supplying all demanded current to each load until there's no
        available current, one could divide the available current between all
        the loads. This approach has the benefit that the number of supply
        interruptions is lower than the previous method. It introduces a new
        objective imposing that the current between loads has to be as equal as
        possible.

        To solve the problem with this new restriction, one could use the same
        approach as before. This time, the tasks would be split in multiple
        smaller tasks with the minimum change of current possible. That is,
        instead of having one task for each load, we would have X tasks for each
        load where X would depend on the demanded current and the minimum
        current step.

          the full current demand. Using these tasks, the algorithm should
          iterate four times (one for each task), reserving the current in the
          nodes accordingly. By splitting the tasks in multiple smaller tasks
          with the smallest increments of current possible, we are able to
          reorder the resulting tasks such that in each iteration the system
          reserves a small current for each load. This time, the algorithm
          iterates seventeen times (one for each task) looping through the loads
          reserving the smallest current each time. In the illustration, the
          different loops are shown by a blank space between the tasks in the

        By measuring the current consumption in the intermediate nodes (measured

        we can infer the current from uncontrollable elements (uncontrollable
        current) as uncontrollable current = measured current - sum(controllable
        current). This gives us a new starting point for the calculation of the

        This means that

        In a system with no neutral wire, any combination of two of the three
        wires will be connected to the loads. The electrons in the wires will
        experience a difference of potencial equal to the difference of the
        alternating potentials of the connected wires. This means that the

        With the deeper understanding of how electricity works, the system must
        now consider the contributions to the current of each controllable load
        as a vector instead of a scalar.

        First of all, the phase mapping is used to transform the current
        consumption reported by a controllable load to three polar vectors
        representing the contributions to the current for each wire.

      <p id="d6248263-96b3-4b29-be09-b80e3bab2189" class="">
        The addition and subtraction made in the intermediate nodes while
        reserving are now vectorial operations, as now every current
        contribution from a controllable load or a meter is a polar vector.

        Finally, the way to calculate the available current in a circuit breaker
        or intermediate node has to change to consider the magnitude (length) of
        the current vector in the node. The circuit breaker's limit is actually
        a limit on the total current vector magnitude. This introduces a small
        but powerful change in the way that available current is calculated. The
        available current now depends on the phase (angle) of the current
        vector.

          Figure 16. In the left side, the modifications in the circuit breakers
          representation. Now the available current is illustrated as a circle
          which radius is the current limit. The different loads are phasors, 2D
          vectors, that add up to the circle limit. Each orange vector
          represents a different controllable load. In the right side, the
          modifications of the controllable loads representation. Now the loads
          demand current in certain directions, depending on their mapping. The
          white vectors are the phasors in which the load will consume current,
          the system has control over the length or magnitude of these vectors.
          Depending on the phase mapping of the loads, the loads can have
          multiple phasors, one for each wire connected to the load. The circle
          radius indicates the total current demand.
